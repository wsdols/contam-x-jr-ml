# contam-x-jr-ml

This is a MATLAB implementation of *contam-x-jr*.  

This version is basically a simplified version of *AIRNET*, i.e., it does not provide contaminant calculations.  
It does contain some verification test cases based on those provided in NISTIR-89-4072.  
These tests can be run using the MATLAB Test Browser.
